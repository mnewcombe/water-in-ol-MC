# water-in-ol-MC
Uses a Monte Carlo approach to find best-fit values of magma decompression rate, water diffusivity, and partition coefficient of water between olivine and melt. Required inputs are the measured water concentration gradient across the 'a' axis of an olivine phenocryst and pressure-water relationship in the host magma.
