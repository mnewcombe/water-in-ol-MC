Hi,

It’s better to have all of our files in one repo so that I can include them all with a single DOI and license.

Here’s what I just did:

In the command line, I typed:
git clone https://github.com/mnewcombe/water-in-ol-MC.git

You would type
git clone https://github.com/EFerriss/olivine.git 

That put a copy of all of your files onto my repository.
Then I made a new folder and saved this file in it.

Then to upload that new stuff onto GitHub I went back to the command line, navigated into water-in-ol-MC.git folder and typed

git add .
git commit -m “Liz wuz here”
git push

Try adding your stuff into my repository that way. If you don’t have push access, try submitting a ‘pull request’. We’ll figure it out :)
